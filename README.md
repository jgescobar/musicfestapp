## The Nebula Music Festival App

My third project consisted of using the MEN stack development technologies. With a non relational database of Mongodb, I was able to come up with an application that incorporated the Spotify API to allow specific data obtained from Spotify to be used within my own application. 


## OAUTH 
I used Passport and Spotify OAuth to launch my login in with Spotify authentication. 


## How I came about this idea 

I always wanted to fathom the idea of making my own festival so I figured why not replicate it virtually with the help of the Spotify Api.
